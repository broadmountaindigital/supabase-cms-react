- when creating types, creeate a new file in ./src/types and export it from there, import it into the file(s) it needs to be used in
- do not type any variable or function arguments as 'any' this is bad practice
- always write CSS in src/index.css and never use <style> block in TSX components
- all components that are created must provide a way for the consumer to inject CSS classNames to *every* element in the component. see props on src/components/Login.tsx for an example
