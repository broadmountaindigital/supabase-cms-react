# Plan: Make MultilineEditor More Robust

This plan outlines the steps to improve the robustness of the `MultilineEditor` component by handling cases where a content field does not yet exist and by refining the save logic.

## Phase 1: Core Robustness (COMPLETED ✅)

The following items have been successfully implemented in the current codebase:

- [x] **Update `MultilineEditorProps`:**

  - [x] Re-introduce an optional `defaultValue: string` prop. This will be used as a fallback and for creating new fields.

- [x] **Refactor Fetch Logic:**

  - [x] In the `useEffect` for data fetching, if a `contentField` is not found for the given `fieldName`, set the component's `value` to the `defaultValue` prop.

- [x] **Refactor Save Logic:**

  - [x] Modify the `useEffect` that saves content.
  - [x] If `fieldId` is `null` (meaning the field doesn't exist), call `contentFieldsService.create()` with the `fieldName` and current `value`.
  - [x] After a successful creation, update the `fieldId` in the component's state with the ID of the newly created record.
  - [x] If `fieldId` exists, call `contentFieldsService.update()` as before.

- [x] **Add Error Handling:**
  - [x] Introduce a new state variable, `error: string | null`.
  - [x] Wrap the `create` and `update` calls in a `try...catch` block.
  - [x] If an error occurs, set the `error` state and display it to the user.

## Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience (COMPLETED ✅)

- [x] **Implement Debounced Saving:**

  - [x] Add a configurable debounce delay (default: 1000ms) to prevent excessive API calls during rapid typing.
  - [x] Create a `useDebouncedSave` hook to handle the debouncing logic.
  - [x] Show a subtle "saving..." indicator during the debounce period.
  - [x] Ensure immediate save when exiting edit mode, bypassing debounce.

- [x] **Add Optimistic Updates:**

  - [x] Implement optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance.
  - [x] Show changes immediately while API calls are in progress.
  - [x] Revert changes if API calls fail, with clear error messaging.
  - [x] Add visual indicators to distinguish between saved and pending changes.

- [x] **Enhance Loading States:**
  - [x] Replace generic "Loading..." text with skeleton UI components.
  - [x] Add configurable loading placeholder props.
  - [x] Implement smooth transitions between loading and loaded states.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (COMPLETED ✅)

- [x] **Field Validation System:**

  - [x] Add optional `validation` prop accepting validation rules or schema.
  - [x] Support common validation patterns (min/max length, regex, required).
  - [x] Display inline validation errors without blocking user input.
  - [x] Prevent saving invalid content with clear user feedback.

- [x] **Conflict Resolution:**

  - [x] Implement conflict detection for concurrent edits.
  - [x] Add `updated_at` timestamp checking before saves.
  - [x] Provide conflict resolution UI when concurrent edits are detected.
  - [x] Add optional real-time collaboration features using Supabase subscriptions.

- [x] **Offline Support:**
  - [x] Implement local storage fallback for offline editing.
  - [x] Queue changes when offline and sync when connection is restored.
  - [x] Add visual indicators for offline mode and sync status.
  - [x] Handle conflicts between offline and server changes gracefully.

## Phase 4: Accessibility & Developer Experience

- [ ] **Accessibility Improvements:**

  - [ ] Add proper ARIA labels and descriptions.
  - [ ] Implement keyboard navigation support.
  - [ ] Ensure screen reader compatibility.
  - [ ] Add focus management for error states.
  - [ ] Support high contrast mode and reduced motion preferences.

- [ ] **Enhanced Developer Experience:**

  - [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript generics for custom field types.
  - [ ] Implement field-level configuration options (auto-save, validation, formatting).
  - [ ] Add debug mode with detailed logging and state inspection.
  - [ ] Create Storybook stories for all component variants.
  - [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations:**
  - [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for very long content.
  - [ ] Add configurable character/line limits with graceful handling.
  - [ ] Optimize re-renders using React.memo and callback optimization.
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for components with heavy dependencies.

## Phase 5: Advanced CMS Features

- [ ] **Content Versioning:**

  - [ ] Implement content history tracking.
  - [ ] Add version comparison and rollback functionality.
  - [ ] Create a revision history UI component.
  - [ ] Support branching and merging for complex workflows.

- [ ] **Rich Text Extensions:**

  - [ ] Add optional rich text editing capabilities.
  - [ ] Support markdown rendering and editing modes.
  - [ ] Implement extensible toolbar system.
  - [ ] Add media embedding and link insertion features.

- [ ] **Workflow Integration:**
  - [ ] Add content approval workflows.
  - [ ] Implement draft/published state management.
  - [ ] Support scheduled publishing.
  - [ ] Add comment and collaboration features.

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Backward Compatibility**: All enhancements should maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations.
- **Bundle Size**: Consider lazy loading and code splitting for advanced features to keep the core bundle lightweight.
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests, and visual regression tests.
- **Documentation**: Update component documentation and provide migration guides for breaking changes.

### Performance Targets

- **Initial Load**: < 100ms for component initialization
- **Save Operations**: < 200ms for typical content field updates
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory leaks, proper cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions
- **Bundle Impact**: Core functionality should add < 5KB to bundle size

### Error Recovery

- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms
- **Validation Errors**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Concurrent Access**: Conflict resolution with user-friendly interfaces
- **Data Corruption**: Backup and recovery mechanisms for critical content
